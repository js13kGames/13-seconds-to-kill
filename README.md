# 13-Seconds-To-Kill-
A indie web game created by juniors programers from Brasil.

It's our firt time developing a game to 13kgames, the chalange was quite hard we went through thick and thin and we were barely abled to make it in time. But it was an awesome jorney wich provided to us a lot of experience and learning.
We are sorry for the final version of the code not being very clean and readeble, but in the next year we will definitely deliver a better code. <3
